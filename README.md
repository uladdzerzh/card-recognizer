# Card_Recognizer

Card Recognizer is a program which can identify playing cards through the webcam. The user simply puts the card on a flat surface, and the program will threshold the image, find the card, isolate the corner, break it into rank and suit, and run both against a neural network to identify their value. It can identify as many cards as can fit on a frame, and different sets of decks can be used too. It processes the frame using the popular Python library OpenCV, and then uses a Tensorflow model to predict its suit and value.
